# Introduction to Firestore (at HOTH7)

## Before We Get Started

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as well as a text
editor of your choice (we will be using
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Setting Up the Project

Open up your terminal application (Terminal on MacOS, Powershell on Windows)
and execute the following commands. (Note: the "\$" character is not part of
the command).

```
$ npx create-react-app meme-app
$ cd meme-app
$ npm install firebase --save
$ npm start
```

You should see something like this in your browser:

Now open the project folder in your text editor. Navigate to the `src` folder
and replace the code in the following files with the code in the corresponding
link:

`App.js`: [code](web-start/src/App.js)

`App.css`: [code](web-start/src/App.css)

`index.css`: [code](web-start/src/index.css)

In addition, create two new files in the `src` directory and copy the linked code into them:

`Meme.js`: [code](web-start/src/Meme.js)

`Meme.css`: [code](web-start/src/Meme.css)

Make sure to save all of your changes! Then you should see something that looks
like this:

![](images/base_app.png)

Try adding some memes to the page! Wow, memes are great. But oh no... when we
refresh the page, all of our precious memes disappear!! :0 :c

In order to make a meme page that actually stores and displays all the memes
we submitted, we'll need some sort of database. Enter... Firebase!!

## Creating a Firebase Project

To get started, log in to [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and
you should get a screen that looks like this;

![](images/projects.png)

Click the "add project" button, which should prompt you to enter the project's
name.

![](images/create_project_0.png)

Then hit continue, and you'll be prompted to use Google Analytics. This will
require some additional setup, so I won't be enabling it. However, it is a
pretty useful tool for measuring app usage and user engagement, if that's
something you're interested in.

## Adding an App to the Project

Now you should see the project overview. Since we're using a web app, let's
click the button to add a web app to the project.

![](images/project_overview.png)

Choose a nickname for your app, and then hit "register app"

![](images/add_app_0.png)

Next, we're going to need to add the firebase configuration to our app. Your screen
should look something like the image below.

![](images/add_app_1.png)

Create a `lib` folder inside the `src` folder, and create a `firebase.js` file
inside of it. Copy the code under the "Your web app's Firebase configuration"
and "Initialize Firebase" comments, and paste it into the `firebase.js` file.
Now modify the file to look like this (the config part should be from the code
you copied, not exactly the same as below!):

```js
import firebase from "firebase";

const config = {
	apiKey: "AIzaSyBVkHrj182dfk4NAEfwcRPN_DkC_HOOk8Q",
	authDomain: "hoth7-firebase-workshop.firebaseapp.com",
	databaseURL: "https://hoth7-firebase-workshop.firebaseio.com",
	projectId: "hoth7-firebase-workshop",
	storageBucket: "hoth7-firebase-workshop.appspot.com",
	messagingSenderId: "328418075634",
	appId: "1:328418075634:web:2b44d5c432aa54189c016b",
};

firebase.initializeApp(config);

export default firebase;
```

## Adding a Firebase Database

On the left sidebar, click the "database" button, and you should see a screen
like this:

![](images/database_0.png)

Click create database, and for security rules, we are going to start
in test mode (although in production, you'll want more stringent security rules).

![](images/database_1.png)

For the Cloud Firestore location, I'm going to choose a server in the US west
region.

![](images/database_2.png)

## Firebase Databases

Now that we have our database, let's create some sample data for our app to use.
First, let's add a new collection by clicking "start collection".

![](images/add_collection_0.png)

I'm going to name my collection "memes". The name of the collection is what we'll
use to refer to it in our code later. After picking a name, click the "next" button.

![](images/add_collection_1.png)

Now we can add our first document to the "memes" collection. I'm going
to use an autogenerated ID. This document will have two fields, both strings.
The first will be a field called "name", which I'll set to "Jamie". In addition,
the document will have an "imgURL" field. Here, I'll input a link to [the image
that I want displayed](https://i.redd.it/f322t7u6sih41.jpg).

## Using the Database in the App

Our final step will be to make our app use the database, and listen for changes
to it. First, we need to import the firebase file we made earlier. In the
`App.js` file, add the following line:

```js
import firebase from "./lib/firebase.js";
```

Next, copy the following code and paste it into the `listenForMemes` method:

```js
// Set up event listener for changes to "memes" collection
listenForMemes = () => {
	this.db = firebase.firestore();

	this.unsubscribeFromMemes = this.db
		.collection("memes")
		.onSnapshot((querySnapshot) => {
			let memeList = [];

			// Parse each document into our memeList
			querySnapshot.forEach(function(doc) {
				let meme = doc.data();
				let newMeme = {
					name: meme.name,
					imgURL: meme.imgURL,
				};
				memeList.push(newMeme);
			});

			// Update data with our new memeList
			this.setState({
				memes: memeList,
			});
		});
};
```

Additionally, add the following code into the `componentWillUnmount` method:

```js
componentWillUnmount = () => {
	// Stop listening for changes to "memes" collection
	this.unsubscribeFromMemes();
};
```

Woah. What exactly is going on here? The answer is: a lot, but we'll go through
it step by step.

First of all, what is `componentDidMount`? This is some React stuff, and I
encourage you to look it up if you're making a React app. For the sake of this
workshop, basically the code in `componentDidMount` runs when the component/app
is first opened. Similarly, the code in `componentWillUnmount` gets run right
before the component/app is closed by the user.

```js
this.db = firebase.firestore();
```

This line creates a reference to our database, allowing us to access it using
`this.db`.

```js
this.unsubscribe = this.db.collection("memes")
    .onSnapshot((querySnapshot) => {
        ...
    });
```

Here, we are using `onSnapshot` method provided by firebase to listen for changes to the "memes" collection.
Each time a document is added, changed, or removed from the collection, we
recieve a query snapshot. This snapshot captures the current contents, and is
updated every time the contents change.

In addition, `onSnapshot` returns a method that allows us to detach the
listener (i.e. stop listening). Thus, we can call this method in
`componentWillUnmount` to detach the listener.

Every time our query snapshot gets changed, the function inside of the
`onSnapshot()` method gets called. Let's take a clsoer look at our function:

```js
(querySnapshot) => {
	let memeList = [];
	querySnapshot.forEach(function(doc) {
		let meme = doc.data();
		let newMeme = {
			name: meme.name,
			imgURL: meme.imgURL,
		};
		memeList.push(newMeme);
	});
	this.setState({
		memes: memeList,
	});
};
```

Here, we do some stuff with the snapshot data. First, we create a new empty
array called `memeList`. Then, we use `forEach` to do something with each
doc inside our "memes" collection snapshot. We first use the `.data()` method
to obtain the doc's data, and store this in `meme`. Then we create an object
called `newMeme`, and give it the necessary information. Finally, we push
this meme into the `memeList` array.

After the loop is finished, we use `setState` to change the state of our app to
the new `memeList` array that we created.

This is enough to allow our app to retrieve data from the database and display
it! However, we also want to be able to add memes to our database using our app.
We'll do this by modifying the `sendMeme` method, making it also send the meme
data to the database.

Let's replace the current `updateMemeCollection` implementation with the following:

```js
// Add a document containing new meme information to "memes" collection
updateMemeCollection = (newMeme) => {
	this.db
		.collection("memes")
		.add(newMeme)
		.then(function(docRef) {
			// Successful update
			console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
		})
		.catch(function(error) {
			// Error updating database
			console.error("Error adding document: ", error);
		});
};
```

Make sure to save the changes, and now let's try adding a meme to the app! If
we refresh the page, the meme we added should still be there!! Pretty neat.

Let's take a closer look at the portion of code that we added:

```js
this.db
	.collection("memes")
	.add(newMeme)
	.then(function(docRef) {
		console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		console.error("Error adding document: ", error);
	});
```

First, we see that we're using the `this.db` reference to our database, and
we're accessing the "memes" collection within it. We're calling the `add` method
on this collection, with the `newMeme` object we created. This is what creates
a doc in the database for our new meme.

What about the `.then` and `.catch` parts? Basically, if the `add` succeeds, the
`.then` code gets executed, but if it doesn't, the `.catch` code executes.
